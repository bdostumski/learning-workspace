# Node JS

## HELMET

Helmet is a security-focused middleware for Node.js applications, designed to help secure Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. These headers protect the application from some common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other attacks that can be mitigated through setting appropriate headers.

## CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows web servers to define which domains are permitted to access resources on the server from a different domain. This is essential in modern web applications where resources are often shared between different origins, but it's also a potential security concern, hence the need for proper configuration.

## XSS-CLEAN

XSS-CLEAN is a middleware used in Node.js applications, particularly with Express, to sanitize user inputs and protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. XSS attacks occur when attackers inject malicious scripts into web applications, which are then executed in the context of a user's browser.

## EXPRESS-RATE-LIMIT

EXPRESS-RATE-LIMIT is a middleware for Express applications that helps mitigate DoS (Denial of Service) and brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specified timeframe. This can be crucial in preventing abuse and maintaining the performance and availability of your web application.
