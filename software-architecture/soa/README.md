# Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)


**Definition:** SOA involves designing software as a collection of services, where each service performs a specific business function and communicates over a network.

**Difference from Microservices:** While both SOA and microservices promote service-based architecture, microservices are more granular and independently deployable.
