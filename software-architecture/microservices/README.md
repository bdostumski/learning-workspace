# Microservices


**Definition:** Microservices architecture is a style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services, each running in its process and communicating through lightweight mechanisms, often HTTP/REST.


- **Characteristics:**
   - **Decentralized Data Management:** Each service manages its own database.
   - **Independent Deployment:** Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
   - **Resilience:** Failure in one service does not affect the entire system.
